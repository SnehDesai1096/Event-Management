# Event-Management

This a project that I did for a resort where it's used to book all the events and rooms that are booked on a particular day. It's not the complete booking portal, it's more over like a portal where you do rough booking. There are there modules in this project as of now for the three different part of the resort. One is the Hotel, One is the Banquet Hall and the last is the Party Plot where all the events and functions are to be held.

It's a running project but all you need to do is update the database. And download Codeigniter and add the "system" and "user_guide" folder to the project. i could'nt add the folder as i had some side issues, so please bare with me.
